# About Me

Hello, my name is Jose Jimenez.

My interest is in solving life's hardware problems. Majoring in Electrical Engineering and Biomedical Engineering (Mechanical concentration), I have the knowledge to built physical products that can interact with the world and change it. My goal is to create hardware systems that contribute to solve our current problems we have today.

Some of the issues I am interested in improving are personal health, climate change, and improving transportation.

# Table of Projects

| Project Name | Project Description | Project Link |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| CO2 Monitoring Network | Senior project group designed a node network of CO2 and temperature sensors using my custom PCBs for the microcontroller; loaded with firmware developed by me. | [Here](https://github.com/JoseJimenez98/CO2_Monitoring_Network) |
| Embedded MP3 Player | Created and verified the implementation of MP3 player on Texas Instruments TM4C1294 ARM microcontroller. Implemented hardware peripheral drivers such as a keyboard input, an LED screen, an SD card reader, and an audio jack using I2C and UART communication protocols. Used interrupts to prioritize a target audio sampling rate of 44.1kHz while concurrently maintaining an LED screen and user button functions in C. | [Here](https://github.com/JoseJimenez98/embedded_mp3_player/tree/main) |
| Perceptron Learning Algorithm | Implement a PLA in MATLAB. Train said algorithm and test it on "real" data that will give us statistics on how well it performed computational learning. | [Here](https://github.com/JoseJimenez98/computational_intelligence/tree/main/Perceptron%20Learning%20Algorithm) |
| Pocket Algorithm | Implement a Pocket Algorithm in MATLAB. Train said algorithm and test it on the USPS handwritten digit database that will give us statistics on how well it performed classifying between handwritten ones' and fives'. | [Here](https://github.com/JoseJimenez98/computational_intelligence/tree/main/Pocket%20Algorithm) |
| Logistic Regression Algorithm | Implement a Logistic Regression Algorithm in MATLAB. Train said algorithm and test it on the USPS handwritten digit database that will give us statistics on how well it performed classifying between handwritten ones' and the rest of the digits (0 and 2-9). | [Here](https://github.com/JoseJimenez98/computational_intelligence/tree/main/Logistc%20Regression%20Algorithm) |
| Regularization and Validation Algorithm | Implement a 10-fold cross validation algorithm in MATLAB. Use that validation algorithm to determine the best regularization parameter to use to regularize a linear regression algorithm and test it on the USPS handwritten digit database that will give us statistics on how well it performed classifying between handwritten ones' and the rest of the digits (0 and 2-9). | [Here](https://github.com/JoseJimenez98/computational_intelligence/tree/main/Regularization%20and%20Validation) |
