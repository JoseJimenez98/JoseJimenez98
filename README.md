Hi, my name is Jose Jimenez.

My interests are in embedded and robotics software design. Majoring in Electrical Engineering, I have gained the knowledge in 
the hardware side of those fields and also the software. My goal is to create robots or embedded software systems that 
contribute to solve our current problems we have today.

Some of the issues I am interested in improving are local health, reducing our harmful effects on Earth, and finding new forms of mental health care.
