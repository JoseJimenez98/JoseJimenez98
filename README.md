# About Me

Hello, my name is Jose Jimenez.

My interest is in embedded systems design. Majoring in Electrical Engineering, I have gained the knowledge in 
the hardware side of that field and also the software. My goal is to create embedded systems that 
contribute to solve our current problems we have today.

Some of the issues I am interested in improving are personal health, climate change, and improving the lives of those with disablities.
