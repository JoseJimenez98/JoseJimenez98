# About Me

Hello, my name is Jose Jimenez.

My interest is in embedded systems design. Majoring in Electrical Engineering, I have gained the knowledge in 
the hardware side of that field and also the software. My goal is to create embedded systems that 
contribute to solve our current problems we have today.

Some of the issues I am interested in improving are personal health, climate change, and improving transportation.

# Table of Projects

| Project Name | Project Description | Project Link |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| CO2 Monitoring Network | Senior project group designed a node network of CO2 and temperature sensors using my custom PCBs for the microcontroller; loaded with firmware developed by me. | [Here](https://github.com/JoseJimenez98/CO2_Monitoring_Network) |
| Perceptron Learning Algorithm | Implement a PLA in MATLAB. Train said algorithm and test it on "real" data that will give us statistic on how well it performed computational learning. | [Here](https://github.com/JoseJimenez98/computational_intelligence/tree/main/Perceptron%20Learning%20Algorithm) |
